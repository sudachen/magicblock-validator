## Overview

The Ephemeral Validator is a Solana Virtual Machine Validator that clones accounts and programs just-in-time and settles state to a reference cluster. 
It is designed to be used in a MagicBlock [Ephemeral Rollup](https://docs.magicblock.gg/introduction) instance to bring potentially anything on Solana, but can also be used as a super-charged [development](https://luzid.app/) environment.


## Ephemeral Rollups

Ephemeral Rollups extend Solana by enabling the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to replace centralized servers. They allow to use the SVM as a serverless, elastic compute for real-time use cases like gaming, finance, and DePIN, while keeping all smart contracts and state on Solana.

The core intuition is that by harnessing the SVM’s account structure and its capacity for parallelization, we can split the app/game state into shards. Users can lock one or multiple accounts to temporarily transfer the state to an auxiliary layer, which we define as the “ephemeral rollup”, a configurable dedicated runtime.

The Ephemeral Rollups instances always originate from a reference cluster, which is the source of truth for the state (programs and accounts). The session is eventually settled back to the reference cluster.

For the full documentation, please refer to the [Ephemeral Rollups](https://docs.magicblock.gg/Accelerate/ephemeral_rollups) page.

## Building

### **1. Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.**

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ rustup component add rustfmt
```


### **2. Download the source code.**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/magicblock-labs/magicblock-validator.git
$ cd magicblock-validator
```

### **3. Build.**

```bash
$ cargo build
```

## Running the Ephemeral Validator

The validator supports configurations for the different use cases. The configuration files is a TOML file (some examples can be found in [configs](./configs)). Additionally, the configuration can be overridden by environment variables.

For example, to run the ephemeral validator on the devnet cluster, run:

```bash
$ cargo run -- configs/ephem-devnet.toml
```

Additionally, the validator can also be run with docker: [magicblocklabs/validator](https://hub.docker.com/r/magicblocklabs/validator)

## Testing

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
$ make test
```

## Integration Tests

**Running an integration test locally requires:**

### **1. Start a localnet cluster:**

```bash
$ cd test-integration
$ ./configs/run-test-validator.sh
```

### **2. Run the ephemeral validator:**

```bash
$ cargo run -- configs/ephem-localnet.toml
```

### **3. Run the integration test, e.g:**

```bash
$ cargo test --test 01_invocations test_schedule_commit_directly_with_single_ix --profile test
```

## Accessing the remote development cluster

* `ephemeral devnet` - stable public cluster for development accessible via
  https://devnet.magicblock.app. It uses solana devnet as base cluster for cloning and settling.

## Open Source

Open Source is at the heart of what we do at Magicblock. We believe building software in the open, with thriving communities, helps leave the world a little better than we found it.
